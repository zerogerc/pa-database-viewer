To run server first create a directory with the name `data` and 
download database from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13ECQHnNMcJXqxHAIJJwNu5s7drHXL0Sa). 
We will host this database on a server in the future.

# Debug
Run server with `./scripts/run_server_debug.sh` and go to client directory. From there you can call `yarn start`.

# Production
Go to the client directory and run `yarn build`. Then run server with `./scripts/run_server_production.sh`.
